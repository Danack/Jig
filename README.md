Jig
===

Lightweight, fast, flexible PHP templating system.

Jig - "A device that holds a piece of machine work and guides the tools operating on it."

Or to put it another way, a jig allows you to work fast with sharp tools without cutting your fingers off.


Features 
========

* Compiles to PHP class and uses APC/APCu class caching for super-duper performance.

* Dynamic inheritance.

* Super lightweight. Zero overhead when templates are already compiled when used with APC/OPCache



How it works
============




TODO
====

* Add test case for dynamic include.

* Add more Typehints to function calls as some are missing.

* Replace the preg_match_all with a sane parser.

* Add more examples.

* Write some documentation.
