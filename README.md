Jig
===

Lightweight, fast, flexible PHP templating system.

Jig - "A device that holds a piece of machine work and guides the tools operating on it."

Or to put it another way, a jig allows you to work fast with sharp tools without cutting your fingers off.


TODO
====

Function getProxiedClass($className){} in class PHPTemplateView needs moving to this project as it implements the dynamic inheritance.
